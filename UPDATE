 Updating from 1.6.x to 1.7.0
==============================

Because of the many changes in 1.7.0 we recommend to use a clean install 
and update the configuration files as necesarry. Things to note:
1. you now need GNU make to build PvPGN on POSIX systems (on Linux this is 
just "make" but on *BSD is "gmake")
2. d2trans,gametrans,w3trans have been unified under address_translation.conf 
file which has a complete new syntax so take care with that
