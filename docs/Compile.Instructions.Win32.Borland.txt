PvPGN Win32 Borland Compile Instructions

This file explains how to compile PvPGN for Win32 using Borland C++ Compiler 5.5



1) Download Borland C++ Compiler 5.5 (BCC32) from one of the folling sites:

ftp://ftpd.borland.com/download/bcppbuilder/freecommandLinetools.exe

http://altd.borland.com/download/bcppbuilder/freecommandLinetools.exe



2) Install the tools to a directory, e.g. c:\program files\borlandc\ (this will be used as an example in the following)



3) Go to the /bin subdirectory, e.g. c:\program files\borlandc\bin



4) Create a file named bcc32.cfg and insert the following two lines:

-I"c:\program files\borlandc\Include"

-L"c:\program files\borlandc\Lib;c:\program files\borlandc\Lib\PSDK"

(replace c:\program files\borlandc\ with your own borland path of course)



5) Create a file named ilink32.cfg and insert the following line:

-L"c:\program files\borlandc\Lib;c:\program files\borlandc\Lib\PSDK"

(replace c:\program files\borlandc\ with your own borland path of course)



Those two files are required by the compiler to find the Lib and Include directory...



6) Now you're ready to compile the server. 

Open a command prompt, go to the Win32-Projects directory.

To build all apps as console apps (recommended for running as a service): make_borland

To build GUI versions of bnetd, d2cs and d2dbs: make_borland -DWITH_GUI



The resulting exe file will be in the sbin directory and you can use it with the other files from the latest PvPGN release.



Notes about CDB Support:

------------------------

To add support for CDB file storage add -DWITH_CDB to the command line options



Notes about MYSQL Support:

--------------------------

First of all u need to add a subfolder src/mysql/ where u add the header files from your favorite mySQL release.

If you wish to compile with MYSQL support, run "make_borland -DWITH_SQL_MYSQL" in src directory.

Note that libmySQL.lib does not work with borland compilers, so we converted it using the borland tool 

COFF2OMF libmySQL.lib libmySQL_bc.lib

You might want to do the same if you want to have a current lib file, alternatively you can create the lib from the dll:

IMPLIB libmysql_bc.lib libmysql.dll



Note that we're working with VS.NET mostly so there might still be borland-related bugs.
